    <p class="learn" id="rules-text">
        Spyfall is a party game for four or more players. At the beginning of the game, eachplayer
        receives a location (the same location as everyone else), except for the spies. The spies don't
        know the location, only their role as the spy. Players will then take turns asking each other yes
        or no questions. The spies are trying to deduce what the location is while attempting to remain
        undetected. At any point, a player may accuse another of being a spy, and if the majority agrees,
        that player is voted out and must reveal their identity. The game ends when all of the spies are
        discovered or when one of them correctly guesses the secret location.
